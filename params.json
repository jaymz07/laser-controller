{"name":"Laser-controller","tagline":"Program for controlling simple laser galvo using computer's sound card.","body":"Description\r\n--------------------------\r\nAnalog signal generator for driving laser galvo.\r\nAllows the laser galvo kits that can be inexpensively purchashed to be controlled by a computer's audio jack.\r\n\r\nThis program generates X/Y parametric signals from an on-screen drawing through the sound card.\r\nUses the sound card to generate analog voltages which are suitable, usually after amplification, for driving a laser scanner galvo.\r\nThis program also works to generate pictures on an oscilloscope set to X/Y channel mode.\r\n\r\nThe right channel outputs voltages corresponding to X position, while the left channel gives voltages corresponding to Y position.\r\n\r\nAlso has the ability to load signals from a text file and output them.\r\n\r\nWARNING: This program can generate signals which are very harsh if played though audio speakers. \r\n\t The signals may even be damaging if played at high volume.\r\n\t Turn system volume almost all the way down if not connected to a laser scanner.\r\n\r\nCompile instructions\r\n------------------------\r\nIf the make system is installed, the package can be compiled by the command:\r\nmake\r\n\r\nOtherwise the standard java compiler can be used directly:\r\njavac GraphicalLaserOutput.java\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n--------------------------\r\nTo run program:\r\njava GraphicalLaserOutput\r\n\r\n\r\n  User inputs:\r\n  -------------------\r\n  \r\n    Mouse:\r\n      Click or drag to add points to laser path.\r\n    \r\n    Keyboard:\r\n      Backspace --\tRemove last point drawn\r\n      C\t\t--\tClear entire drawing\r\n      S\t\t--\tSine wave animation mode\r\n      \r\n\r\nCurrent Features\r\n------------------------------------\r\n - Able to output drawings as they are being done by user\r\n - Load a drawing from a file to be output through sound card\r\n - Rotation of current drawing\r\n - Generate sine wave animation (very cool if laser scanner is used with a fog machine :D )\r\n - User controlled speed reduction.\r\n\r\n \r\nCompatability\r\n------------------------------------\r\n - Should run on anything that supports the Java Runtime Environment\r\n - Should work with laser scanners up to 44K points/sec (higher can be achieved with higher sample rate audio)\r\n    - Note: this will work regardless if scanner is connected. \r\n      Since it is attached to computer via audio jack, the computer has no way of knowing if it is actually connected\r\n\r\n![Laser Galvo kit](http://laserpointerforums.com/attachments/f47/29435d1284838353-scanner-newbie-howto-spacelas-pt-20k-galvos.jpg)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
